# Case-Study-6_Life-Expectancy-Prediction
The case study is about to figure out the main effective predictors of life expectancy using ML model (regression). Also an application is deployed on R shiny app, where the parameters can be changed to see the effective results.

## The .R file is saved as ipynb file to ensure the delievery of visualize the results directly.

**According to Case study given for the assignment in subject DS501- Introduction to data science, this file covers the details on following question:**

1) Selecting a dataset - Life Expectancy Dataset

2) Selecting an algorithm for the dataset - Regression

3) mathematical/statistical details of the algorithm are explained with the algorithm inside file with each cell.

## The folder Case-Study-DS contains the implementatin for the shiny app code 

**Shiny application giving end user options to change parameters and to see how do they effect in results.**

4) The folder contains the ui.R and server.R file.

5) Deployed application can be found and operated at: link (https://37lehk-paris099-mittal.shinyapps.io/case-study-ds/)
